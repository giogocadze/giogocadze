## About Me

I am a Front-End  & IOS Developer based in Tbilisi, Georgia, focused on building reliable, production-ready web interfaces. My work centers on clean code and well-structured front-end systems that scale with both product and team growth. I care deeply about UI/UX quality, performance, and accessibility, and I enjoy collaborating with designers and engineers to turn complex  requirements into clear, maintainable solutions. I continuously refine my skills through real projects, code reviews, and learning modern best practices.
