## About Me

I am a Front-End Developer based in Tbilisi, Georgia, focused on building reliable, production-ready web interfaces with React and Next.js.  
My work centers on clean code, reusable components, and well-structured front-end systems that scale with both product and team growth.

I care deeply about UI/UX quality, performance, and accessibility, and I enjoy collaborating with designers and engineers to turn complex 
requirements into clear, maintainable solutions. I continuously refine my skills through real projects, code reviews, and learning modern best practices.
